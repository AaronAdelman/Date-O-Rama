# Date-O-Rama

This is an in-progress date/time program for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS which does things which Apple’s software does not do.  

* Localized dates and times in every supported language
* Multiple locations, including Mars
* Hebrew and Muslim calendars corrected so the day starts at Sunset, including Solar time
* The Julian and French Republican calendars
* Multiple variants on Julian dates
* Over 5,000 observances (national, international, religious, cultural, and astronomical) built-in
* Intelligent event collation

NOTE:  As of this writing, the UI of Date-O-Rama is being revised (along with various other parts of the program).  If you compile the program, expect it to look different that the images below.
