# What is Adelsoft’s policy on your personal information?

Short version:  Your personal information is yours alone, and Adelsoft has no access to it.

Long version:

1. Date-O-Rama sends **zero** personal information back to Adelsoft.  Adelsoft has no need for such information and does not want it.
1. The user’s preferences are stored in iCloud and on your device.  They are never shared with Adelsoft or anyone else.
1. If the user decides to have dates and times reported for his/her current location, the current location will be periodically written to the device’s iCloud account or the device itself.  This information makes it easier to start up Date-O-Rama quickly.  It also makes it possible for Date-O-Rama to continue to work if the current location cannot be determined; the last recorded location will be used instead.  It will never be sent to Adelsoft or anyone else.
1. Date-O-Rama does not require access to the device’s current location to function.  (Clocks which are set for the device’s current location, however, cannot update their location automatically without the relevant access.)  Solar position-related functionality will work sufficiently well for most purposes with access to only a reduced-precision location.
1. Date-O-Rama does not require access to the user’s calendar events and contacts to function.  (Naturally, events that show up in Calendar.app are not visible without this access.)
