17. [Coordinated Mars Time (MTC, Martian Coordinated Time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Coordinated_Mars_Time)

The time systems of most of the non-Apple calendars are not the common 24-hour fixed clock.  The corrected Hebrew and Islamic calendars use solar time (day and night each have 12 hours, and the length of said hours changes with the time of year).  Those Julian date calendars which support time express time as a decimal fraction of the day.
